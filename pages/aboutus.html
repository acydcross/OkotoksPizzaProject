            There are no short cuts when it comes to our passion. We pull out all the stops, giving you the ‘wow’
            flavour, experience and consistency you not only want, but deserve. Our customers keep coming back, again,
            again, and again.

            We’re a small but nimble family-run take out and delivery pizza shop in Okotoks, Alberta. When we’re not
            scouring the globe (okay, the prairies) for the freshest, ripest and boldest ingredients, we’re crafting
            perfect pizzas for you and your family to enjoy. From hot Hawaiians and classic Canadians to crispy wings
            and decadent fudge brownies, everything at Okotoks Pizza is baked with love.

            After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, Matt Cleveland learned how to
            make people happy, one topping at a time. Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004, Matt has managed to
            evolve the fresh, traditional Greek-style pizza his family perfected back in the mid 80s to a more modern
            and convenient comfort food for today’s family on the go.

            Okotoks Pizzas are made with only the freshest ingredients like mozzarella, roma tomatoes, made-from-scratch
            sauce and even features premium toppings like Sorriso Pepperoni, salami from Valbella meats and a healthy
            Flax crust. You feel good about ordering it. You feel good about eating it. And you feel even better knowing
            we're always ready to make you more.
